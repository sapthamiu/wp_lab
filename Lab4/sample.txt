File handling refers to the process of performing operations on a file, such as
creating, opening, reading, writing and closing it through a programming
interface.
It involves managing the data flow between the program and the file system on
the storage device, ensuring that data is handled safely and efficiently.
Why do we need File Handling
- To store data permanently, even after the program ends.
- To access external files like .txt, .csv, .json, etc.
- To process large files efficiently without using much memory.
- To automate tasks like reading configs or saving outputs.
