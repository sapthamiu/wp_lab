        <h1>Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening</h1>
        <h4><em>~ Robert Frost</em></h4>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
            Whose woods these are I think I <b>know</b>. <br>
            His house is in the village <b>though</b>; <br>
            He will not see me stopping here <br>
            To watch his woods fill up with <b>snow</b>. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            My little horse must think it <b>queer</b> <br>
            To stop without a farmhouse <b>near</b> <br>
            Between the woods and frozen lake <br>
            The darkest evening of the <b>year</b>. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            He gives his harness bells a <b>shake</b> <br>
            To ask if there is some <b>mistake</b>. <br>
            The only other sound’s the sweep <br>
            Of easy wind and downy <b>flake</b>. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            The woods are lovely, dark and <b>deep</b>, <br>
            But I have promises to <b>keep</b>, <br>
            And miles to go before I <b>sleep</b>, <br>
            And miles to go before I <b>sleep</b>. <br>
            </p>
